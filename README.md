# A repository for testing AUR package builds

This repository is for testing AUR package builds. As it uses a minimal Arch environment, builds on clean Arch installations can be verified

The work in this repository is heavily based on the work done by [aminvakil/aur](https://github.com/aminvakil/aur).
